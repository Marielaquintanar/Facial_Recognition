#Facial_Recognition - Machine Learning Project

## Project description

The Facial Recognition with FaceNet project is a machine learning program that uses facial recognition technology to identify whether
a well-known person is present in other images. The app takes a reference image of a known person and compares their face to faces on other
images to determine whether the known person is present or not. If the known person is not in an image, the program will draw a red bounding box
around the faces in that image.

### Main Features

- Uses FaceNet, a deep neural network for facial feature extraction.
- Performs accurate comparisons of faces using feature vectors.
- Identifies and highlights the presence of the known person in the input images.
- Provides clear visualizations with red bounding boxes in case of absence of the known person.
- Can be used for a variety of applications, such as security, access control and photo organization.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have all dependencies installed.
3. Provide a reference image of the known person and enter images of unfamiliar faces.
5. Run the program.
6. The program will identify if the known person is present in the images and will draw red bounding boxes if not.
